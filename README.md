# PySnake
Contains my minor project code, which is a snake game which can be played in various modes. 
This game can be played in various modes and each mode's speed is controlled using clock speed. 
Although, It has a lot of bugs and incomplete features such as, The intelligence for the evil snake is supposed to be implemented using Dijkstra's Algorithm. But, the implementation doesn't work properly and starts the original classic snake game, which needs to be fixed.
The variable used to control the page open and close features have an issue. Here's it's suppose to work as many times the pages are clicked and the return to homepage, but after one time when a page is entered and the returned to homepage. After again clicking the pages, the screen starts flickering. I assume it's related to clock speed.
Enjoy playing until i fix the bugs and errors.
